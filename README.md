# 1. Introduction

The Vitis™ unified software platform is a new software development product based on a unified flow using XRT (Xilinx runtime). New embedded platforms are supported on the Vitis software platform, and SDSoC platforms are now deprecated. The Vitis software platform replaces the  SDK, SDSoC™, and SDAccel™ development environments. It offers the original SDx environment features along with new features, such as improved profiling and emulation, extensible open-source runtime, and scalable library/application development across data center and embedded technologies. The new DFX version of the platforms provides a shell where the kernel can be programmed without reimplementing the complete hardware design. For more information, visit the [Vitis software platform web page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html).

This guide covers the following embedded vision reference platforms for the Vitis environment. These reference platforms enable you to build computer vision and machine learning accelerators using Vitis platforms which have video source and video sink pipelines running on Zynq® SoCs and MPSoCs:

  - ZCU104 Single Sensor
  - 8-stream VCU + CNN
  - ZCU104 Smart Camera

These Vitis embedded platforms can be generated using [sources](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Embedded_Platform_Source/tree/2019.2). The [pre-built platforms](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html) are also available if you wish to use them directly to build the accelerators.

**:pushpin: NOTE:**
>The ZCU104 Smart Camera platform is supported by both Xilinx and Regulus image signal processing (ISP). The design with the Regulus ISP is not provided here due to licensing limitations; only the SD card image is available for evaluation. For access to the Regulus ISP design, contact Regulus.

For other versions, refer to the [reVISION Getting Started Guide](http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/reVISION%20Getting%20Started%20Guide) overview page on the Xilinx wiki.
